# Custom element / As float

`ChatCustomElement` styled with the float layout CSS and driven by a custom `ChatButton` launcher, replicating `ChatContainer`'s built-in float experience with full control over animations and launcher behavior.

## What this example shows

- Importing `@carbon/ai-chat/css/chat-float-layout.css` and `chat-launcher-layout.css` to reuse the library's float classes (`cds-aichat-float--open`, `--opening`, `--closing`, `--close`, `cds-aichat-launcher`, `--hidden`).
- Suppressing the built-in launcher with `launcher.isOn: false` and providing a custom `ChatButton` from `@carbon/ai-chat-components`.
- Driving open/close state through a `phase` state machine and `onAnimationEnd` / `onViewChange` handlers.
- Calling `instance.changeView(ViewType.MAIN_WINDOW)` to open the chat.
- Handling `prefers-reduced-motion` by advancing the phase immediately when no animation will fire.

## When to use this pattern

- You want the float look-and-feel from `ChatContainer` but need custom launcher icon, position, or animation control.
- You need precise control over when the chat mounts and how its open/close animations behave.

## Run it

**Prerequisite — build the core packages first.** Examples consume the built output of `@carbon/ai-chat-components` and `@carbon/ai-chat`; without this step the dev server will fail with missing-module errors. Rebuild whenever you change anything under `packages/`.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat

npm run start --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-custom-element-as-float
```

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the full setup walkthrough.

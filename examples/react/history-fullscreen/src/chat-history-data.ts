/**
 * History fixture for the chat-history-fullscreen example.
 *
 * Demonstrates: a static dataset of pinned and dated history entries plus
 * the per-row action menus that the writeable history panel renders.
 *
 * APIs exercised:
 *   - `iconLoader` (from `@carbon/web-components`) to provide menu-row icons
 *   - `resultItem`, `resultItemSection` (shape consumed by `HistoryPanelItem` / `HistorySearchItem`)
 *   - `historyItemActions`, `pinnedHistoryItemActions`, `historyItems`, `pinnedHistoryItems`
 *
 * Start reading at: `historyItems` (the regular sectioned list).

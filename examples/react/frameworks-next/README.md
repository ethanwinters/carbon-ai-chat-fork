# Frameworks / Next.js (App Router)

Embeds `ChatContainer` inside a Next.js 16 App Router page, loading the chat as a client-only dynamic import so server rendering is skipped for browser-only dependencies.

## What this example shows

- App Router `app/layout.tsx` + `app/page.tsx` structure.
- `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` to defer `ChatContainer` to the client, with a `loading` placeholder.
- `"use client"` in the chat module because `ChatContainer` touches `window` and custom elements.
- A minimal mocked backend (`customSendMessage`) that echoes the user's input.

## When to use this pattern

- Your app is Next.js App Router and you want chat integrated without touching SSR.
- You need a split between a thin Next page and a larger client component that owns the chat.

## APIs and props demonstrated

| Symbol              | Package / kind              | Role in this example                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ChatContainer`     | `@carbon/ai-chat` component | Mounts the chat UI.                    |
| `PublicConfig`      | `@carbon/ai-chat` type      | Shape of the config.                   |
| `customSendMessage` | `messaging` prop            | Minimal mock backend.                  |
| `next/dynamic`      | `next`                      | Client-only import of the chat module. |

## Run it

**Prerequisite — build the core packages first.** Examples consume the built output of `@carbon/ai-chat-components` and `@carbon/ai-chat`; without this step the dev server will fail with missing-module errors. Rebuild whenever you change anything under `packages/`.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-components
npm run build --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat

npm run dev --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-frameworks-next
```

(Replace `dev` with `build` or `start` as needed — this example also exposes `start` for the production server.)

See [../README.md](../README.md) for the full setup walkthrough.

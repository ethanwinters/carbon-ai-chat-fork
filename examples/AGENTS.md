# AGENTS.md — examples (shared)

Guidance that applies to both [react/](react/) and [web-components/](web-components/). Flavor-specific deltas live in each subdirectory's own `AGENTS.md`.

> **Prerequisite**: packages must be built first. See root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — examples resolve deps through `dist/es/`.

## Running an example

Build the packages first, then from the repo root start any single example by its workspace name (override the default port 3000 with `PORT=`):

```bash
npm run start --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-basic-float
PORT=3001 npm run start --workspace=@carbon/ai-chat-examples-react-basic-custom-element-fullscreen
```

When `npm run aiChat:start` is running in another terminal, example Vite dev servers hot-reload on package rebuilds. This relies on each `vite.config.ts` listing `@carbon/ai-chat` and `@carbon/ai-chat-components` under `optimizeDeps.exclude` — without that, Vite pre-bundles the symlinked workspace packages and a rebuild will not reach the browser.

## Adding a new example

1. **Pick a base and copy it.** Each flavor lists its canonical scaffolds in its own `AGENTS.md`. Both include `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, HTML entry, and `package.json`. Rename the folder to `<slug>` and update the workspace name to the flavor's naming pattern.
2. **Modify only what your example needs to demonstrate.** Keep the bundler, scripts, and file layout unless the example is specifically about a different toolchain (e.g. `frameworks-next/`, `frameworks-react-17/`, `tests-jest-*/`). For a different toolchain, copy from the closest matching existing example.
3. **Point `index.html` at your entry module.** Vite resolves the entry from a `<script type="module" src="/src/App.tsx">` tag in the HTML (`/src/main.ts` for web components) rather than injecting one, so renaming the entry file means editing the HTML too.
4. **Write a `README.md`** from [README_TEMPLATE.md](README_TEMPLATE.md) — required. It must follow the [Indexer Contract](references/indexer-contract.md).
5. **Regenerate the aggregator** by running `npm run repair:example-readmes` — this rewrites the section list in [react/README.md](react/README.md) / [web-components/README.md](web-components/README.md) from the per-example READMEs.

## Smoke tests

Playwright is the smoke-test mechanism for examples. The golden examples are covered by one central suite in [shared/playwright/](shared/playwright/): run it with `npm run test:e2e:goldens`. An example holds no Playwright config, dependency, or script of its own. `tests-vitest-happydom` and both `tests-jest-*` examples use `test` for another runner. The existing `frameworks-react-17` and `frameworks-react-18` Playwright suites also use `test`. Keep them in the root `npm test` run until they move to the shared setup in #1424.

Read [playwright.md](references/playwright.md) before adding or changing an example's tests. It carries where specs live, how to add a target, how a port is allocated, the selector rules, and the four examples that are deliberately skipped.

## Definition of done

- `npm run build --workspace=<example>` exits 0.
- `npm run test:e2e:goldens -- --project <target>` passes, if the example is a target in [targets.ts](shared/playwright/targets.ts).
- `npm run test --workspace=<example>` passes, if the example has a `test` script.
- README follows the [Indexer Contract](references/indexer-contract.md).

A Playwright suite is **not** required here yet: most examples have none, so the requirement would fail repo-wide today. Hardening this list to require one, with the four skips carved out, is the closing step of [issue #1424](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/issues/1424).

## Authoring rules

**Single-purpose rule**: each example demonstrates exactly one concern. If a change would add a second concern, create a new example instead. Framework-variant examples (`frameworks-next`, `tests-vitest-happydom`, `tests-jest-happydom`, `tests-jest-jsdom`, `frameworks-react-17`, `frameworks-react-18`) count the framework / test-runner integration as their "one thing" — keep their chat configuration as thin as possible.

**Base-template rule**: non-float examples derive from the `basic-custom-element-fullscreen` baseline — `ChatCustomElement` (or `<cds-aichat-custom-element>`) + `layout.showFrame: false` + `openChatByDefault: true`. The float-pattern examples (`basic-float`, `custom-element-as-float`, `custom-element-as-float-lazy-load`, `history-float`, `watch-state`, `watch-state-redux`) are the documented exceptions — they demonstrate the launcher chat shape with host UI alongside it.

**README alignment rule**: an example's section in the aggregator README ([react/README.md](react/README.md) or [web-components/README.md](web-components/README.md)) must stay in sync with the example's own README — title, summary, start command, and APIs table. Run `npm run verify:example-readmes` (also in `ci-check`) to check; `npm run repair:example-readmes -- --from=examples` to regenerate the aggregator from the per-example READMEs.

**Title-naming rule**: a README's `# H1` title mirrors the slug's prefix family so related examples cluster visually in the aggregator.

| Slug pattern | Title format | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shares a prefix with 3+ siblings (`custom-element-*`, `history-*`, `prompt-line-*`, `frameworks-*`, `tests-*`) | `<Prefix> / <Variant>` (capitalize prefix; sentence-case variant) | `prompt-line-typeahead` → `Prompt line / Typeahead` |
| Canonical baseline (`basic-*`) | `Basic / <Variant>` | `basic-float` → `Basic / Float` |
| Pure variant of one base (e.g. `reasoning-steps-controlled` of `reasoning-steps`) | `<Base name> (<variant>)` | `workspace-sidebar` → `Workspace (sidebar)` |
| Stands alone (no shared prefix family) | Flat sentence case | `feedback` → `Feedback` |
| Sub-variant of a slash-family entry | Keep the slash, append the variant in parens (avoid stacking a second slash) | `prompt-line-typeahead-custom` → `Prompt line / Typeahead (custom list)` |

Capitalize a slug-family prefix the first time you introduce a new family, even when the slug is a singleton today, if you anticipate siblings (e.g. `Integrations / watsonx.ai`).

**Inline comments rule**: comments are the product here, and how to word them is [example-copy.md](../.bob/skills/caic-copy-writer/references/example-copy.md) — type 5. Read it before writing one. The constraint driving those rules is local: the Carbon MCP indexer reads each example in isolation, so nothing in this directory may point at another one.

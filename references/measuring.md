# measuring.md — putting a number on "simpler"

Load this when a review or plan needs a measurement, not an adjective. The rules these numbers serve live in [code-patterns.md](code-patterns.md).

**No CI job runs these** and no build fails on a number — a score is not a finding, it picks what to read.

## Measuring complexity

Two metrics, two jobs. **Cyclomatic** counts branches (`if`, `||`, loops, `case`). **Cognitive** counts how hard the flow is to read. Nesting and chained conditions cost extra. A wide render function can score low on one and high on the other. Both matter.

Current percentiles for this repo. The population is every function in `packages/*/src` and `demo/src`, tests and stories excluded (5,183 functions; 75 above cognitive 10, 33 above 15):

| Metric | p50 | p90 | p95 | p99 | max |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cyclomatic | 1 | 4 | 7 | 13 | 76 |
| Cognitive | 0 | 3 | 5 | 12 | 65 |

To regenerate it, take percentiles over the cyc/cog columns of `npm run complexity -- --report 0` across that population.

How to run:

- `npm run complexity -- <file>` — score a file.
- `npm run complexity -- --changed <base>` — score only the diff, as `cyc:54→55  cog:45→46`.
- `--report <n>` — the print floor: functions at or above `n` on either metric appear (default 10).
- `--max <n>` — exit 1 when a function's cognitive score exceeds `n`.

Severity bands, on the after score: in a primary area, above 15 is Important and above 25 a Blocker.

**Render column.** Every row carries `(render N)`: how many cyclomatic branches sit inside JSX or a Lit `html`/`svg` template. `cond && <Panel />` adds a branch on both metrics but is not hard to read, so a high score that is mostly render is markup, not logic. Position decides and the name never does — `renderWithStaticTag` is the tree's cyclomatic maximum at 76 with `render 0`. Markup context crosses into a callback, but the count follows the nearest function, so a `.map` callback's branches are its own.

**Per-file footer.** After each file's rows: `<file>: N code lines, cognitive total N, deepest block N, widest params N, top-level N`. `--report` filters rows, never footers. Counts on the tree when these were adopted:

| Number | What it is | On this tree |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code lines | `max-lines`, blanks and comments skipped | 26 files over 500 |
| cognitive total | every function in the file, summed | 5 files over 100 |
| deepest block | `max-depth` | 19 blocks deeper than 4, in 5 files |
| widest params | `max-params` | 9 functions over 5 |
| top-level | statements that run on import | 10 or more in 1 of the 615 files above; in 3 of 16 under `scripts/` and `tools/` |

Top-level counts what runs when the module loads. A binding does not count when its initializer is a literal, template, array, object, arrow, function, class, identifier, member access, or a `require()` — the CommonJS spelling of an import. Nor do imports, function, class, and type declarations. A bare call, a loop, an `if`, and a `const x = f()` do. `export` is unwrapped first, so `export const x = f()` counts exactly as the unexported line would.

The initializer is judged by its outermost node, so `const x = [f()]` reads as inert even though `f()` runs. That is the measure's one deliberate simplification: it asks what a statement *is*, not what it reaches.

**Blind spot.** The render count comes from a second parse, joined to the score rows by position. When that parse fails the file prints `render 0` on every row and `top-level 0` — low, never wrong.

 * A text item returned in a message response from an assistant.
 *
 * The Carbon AI Chat supports basic styling inside text responses to match the theme of your Carbon AI Chat,
 * both with Markdown or HTML content returned from your assistant. Using Markdown and `user_defined`
 * ({@link UserDefinedItem}) responses instead of HTML in your text responses is the recommendation. It allows
 * adding channels that do not support HTML (such as Facebook, Slack, or WhatsApp) without having to rewrite
 * your content.
 *
 * ## Markdown
 *
 * The Carbon AI Chat supports the following Markdown syntax in the text response type:
 *
 * **Text formatting:**
 *
 * - `**bold text**` or `__bold text__`
 * - `*italic text*` or `_italic text_`
 * - `~~strikethrough~~`
 * - `==highlighted text==`
 * - `^superscript^`
 * - `~subscript~`
 *
 * **Code:**
 *
 * - `` `inline code` `` or fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting.
 *
 * **Headers:**
 *
 * - `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`, `#### H4`, `##### H5`, `###### H6`
 *
 * **Lists:**
 *
 * - Unordered lists using `*`, `+`, or `-`
 * - Ordered lists using `1.`, `2.`, etc.
 * - Nested lists are supported
 *
 * **Links and images:**
 *
 * - `[link text](URL)` for links (opens in new tab by default)
 * - `![alt text](image URL)` for images
 *
 * **Other elements:**
 *
 * - `> blockquote text` for blockquotes
 * - Tables using pipe syntax with automatic pagination and sorting
 * - Horizontal rules using `---` or `***`
 * - Line breaks are preserved (breaks: true)
 * - Automatic URL detection and conversion to links
 *
 * **Attributes:**
 *
 * - Custom attributes using `{{class="my-class" id="my-id"}}` syntax
 * - Supported attributes: `target`, `rel`, `class`, `id`
 *
 * **HTML support:**
 *
 * - Raw HTML is supported when enabled
 * - Custom elements and web components are allowed
 * - Content is sanitized for security when sanitization is enabled
 *
 * The Carbon AI Chat follows CommonMark rules with these extensions and enhancements.
 *
 * ## HTML content
 *
 * If you include HTML (including `style` and `script` tags) in your text response from your assistant, the
 * Carbon AI Chat renders those elements as provided, unless you set {@link PublicConfig.shouldSanitizeHTML}
 * to `true`. A better approach is to use a `user_defined` response instead of adding HTML directly to your
 * responses to make adding support for channels that do not support HTML easier.

## Overview

Carbon AI Chat is a backend agnostic chat UI design for modern AI based flows. This page shows you how to install it, configure it, and connect it to your server.

You can experiment with different configuration options and settings with the [demo of the Carbon AI Chat](../../demo/index.html).

The demo showcases the full featured chat interface with many available customization options and response types.

## Using the API

### Picking your component

This package provides both React and web component versions of Carbon AI Chat. Each framework exports two versions. One uses a float layout — the classic launcher with chat in the lower-right corner for customer service use cases. The other renders the chat into a container element you choose (sidebar, fullscreen, etc), growing responsively to fill it.

See the [React](./React.md), [web component](./WebComponent.md) and [Angular](./Angular.md) documentation.

## Configuration

Each component accepts {@link PublicConfig}'s options as props that control how the chat looks and behaves before your users see it. Set where the chat renders along with its size, frame, and corners ({@link LayoutConfig}); which surfaces appear — the {@link LauncherConfig launcher} (IBM's or your own), {@link HeaderConfig header}, {@link HomeScreenConfig home screen}, and {@link InputConfig input}; how the chat reaches your server ({@link PublicConfigMessaging}); and its theme, language, and assistant identity. See {@link PublicConfig} for every option.

### Instance methods

You get the {@link ChatInstance} from the {@link ChatContainerProps.onBeforeRender} callback, which the chat calls with the instance before it renders. Each instance provides imperative runtime methods your website can call any time after the instance is available. These methods aren't attributes or props — they affect internal or shared chat state.

Use the instance to add, update, and remove messages ({@link ChatInstanceMessaging}); open, close, or switch the chat view ({@link ChatInstance.changeView}); read or seed the input field ({@link ChatInstanceInput}); subscribe to events ({@link EventHandlers.on}); hand off to a human agent ({@link ChatInstanceServiceDeskActions}); and render your own content into the chat's slots ({@link WriteableElements}). See {@link ChatInstance} for the full API.

### Events

The Carbon AI Chat fires {@link BusEvent events} throughout its life cycle. Subscribe with {@link EventHandlers.on} to react to messages received ({@link BusEventType.RECEIVE}), the chat opening or closing ({@link BusEventType.VIEW_CHANGE}), user feedback ({@link BusEventType.FEEDBACK}), and human-agent handoff. Many events also fire in a `pre:` form the chat awaits before it acts ({@link BusEventType.PRE_SEND}), so a handler can inspect, change, or cancel what happens next. See {@link BusEvent} for every event.

## Connecting to your server

The Carbon AI Chat can send messages and retrieve conversations from your server. It supports both streamed and non-streamed responses.

For more information, see the [connect to your server](./CustomServer.md) documentation.

## Customizing the view

Carbon AI Chat customizes at three levels, from quickest to deepest. Configure behavior and appearance through {@link PublicConfig} props, restyle with a Carbon [theme](./Theming.md) and CSS custom-property tokens for color, sizing, and placement, or inject your own content into [slots](./WriteableElements.md), [custom panels](./CustomPanels.md), [responses](./Responses.md), and [message footers](./CustomMessageFooter.md).

See [UI customization](./Customization.md).

## Service desks

Extend Carbon AI Chat with human agent support with a [service desk](./CustomServiceDesks.md) integration.

## Accessibility

Carbon AI Chat targets [Web Content Accessibility 2.2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/) and [CI 162](https://ibm.biz/IBMCHS162) compliance by end of 2026. Check the current status in the [IBM Accessibility Compliance System](https://able.ibm.com/acs/record/41d02b48-a930-4e17-b6f5-661297349650/dashboard).

## Internationalization

Translate built-in text, format dates for a region, and support right-to-left languages. See [Internationalization](./Internationalization.md).

## Cookies and GDPR

The Carbon AI Chat does not use any cookies. It uses the browser's transient session storage for required behavior to track the state of the Carbon AI Chat as you navigate from page to page (e.g., should the home screen be visible, and so on).

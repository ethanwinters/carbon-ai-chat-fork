## Overview

Carbon AI Chat exports two React components.

{@link ChatCustomElement} renders the chat into an element you size and place — a sidebar, full screen, or nested in your UI — and is the most common choice. {@link ChatContainer} is a convenience component that renders the classic floating widget (a corner launcher and a window that opens on click) by applying the [float layout classes](./Layout.md#floating-layout) for you.

You don't need {@link ChatContainer} for a float layout. Those classes are exported, so you can apply them to {@link ChatCustomElement} yourself and get the same floating widget — see [Float layout](#float-layout). Reach for {@link ChatContainer} only when you'd rather skip that wiring.

> **Note**: This page covers only what's specific to React. For theming, layout, slotting your own content, and the rest of the configuration shared across every framework, see [UI customization](./Customization.md).

For more information, see [the examples page](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react).

> **Note**: This component doesn't support SSR. In Next.js or similar frameworks, render it client-side only.

## Installation

Install with npm:

`npm install @carbon/ai-chat`

Or with yarn:

`yarn add @carbon/ai-chat`

> **Note**: Install the required `peerDependencies`. See the [peer dependency changes](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/blob/main/docs/peer-dependency-changes.md) for a history of additions, removals, and version updates across releases.

### Basic example

Render this component in your application and provide the configuration options for the Carbon AI Chat as individual props. Give it a `className` that sizes it.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ChatCustomElement } from "@carbon/ai-chat";

import "./App.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <ChatCustomElement
      className="MyChat"
      // ... other config properties as individual props
    />
  );
}
```

```css
.MyChat {
  block-size: 100vh;
  inline-size: 100%;
}
```

## Using ChatCustomElement

Use {@link ChatCustomElement} to render the Carbon AI Chat inside a custom element, controlling where the chat renders. This component renders an element in your React app and uses it as the custom element for the chat. See {@link ChatCustomElementProps} for the accepted props.

This component requires a `className` prop that defines the size and positioning of the chat when open. The default behavior sets the element's dimensions to 0x0, so it doesn't take up space while keeping any fixed-positioned launcher visible.

If you want different open/close behavior — say, to animate the chat in and out — provide the {@link ChatCustomElementProps.onViewPreChange} and {@link ChatCustomElementProps.onViewChange} props. {@link ChatCustomElementProps.onViewPreChange} runs before the view changes and is awaited, so you can update your `className` and let an animation finish before the chat shell is hidden. {@link ChatCustomElementProps.onViewChange} runs once the change completes; provide it to replace the default 0x0 sizing.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { ChatCustomElement } from "@carbon/ai-chat";

import "./App.css";

const ChatOptions = {
  messaging: {
    customSendMessage: () => {},
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <ChatCustomElement
      className="MyCustomElement"
      messaging={chatOptions.messaging}
      // ... other config properties
    />
  );
}
```

```css
.MyCustomElement {
  position: absolute;
  inset-inline-start: 100px;
  inset-block-start: 100px;
  inline-size: 500px;
  block-size: 500px;
}
```

### Float layout

The float layout pins the chat to the corner of the page as a launcher button that opens a floating window — the widget {@link ChatContainer} renders for you. To get that same layout on your own {@link ChatCustomElement} instead, import `@carbon/ai-chat/css/chat-float-layout.css` and apply the `cds-aichat-float--*` classes through `className`, driven by the chat's view-change events. See [Float layout classes](./Layout.md#floating-layout) for the class list, and the [custom-element-as-float example](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/custom-element-as-float) for the full pattern. To skip this wiring, use {@link ChatContainer}.

## Using ChatContainer

{@link ChatContainer} renders the floating widget for you — it applies the [float layout classes](./Layout.md#floating-layout) and has no element to size. Reach for it when you want the classic corner launcher and pop-over window with no layout work.

See {@link ChatContainerProps} for the accepted props.

## Accessing instance methods

Capture the {@link ChatInstance} from {@link ChatContainerProps.onBeforeRender} (or {@link ChatContainerProps.onAfterRender}) when you need to call instance methods later. See those props for an example.

## User-defined responses

This component can also manage `user_defined` responses. (See {@link UserDefinedItem}). For what `user_defined` responses are and how they're styled, see [Customizing responses](./Responses.md). You must pass a {@link ChatContainerProps.renderUserDefinedResponse} function as a render prop. This function returns a React component that renders content for the specific message that relates to that response.

Treat the {@link ChatContainerProps.renderUserDefinedResponse} prop like any typical React render prop. It is called every time the App rerenders and every time a new `user_defined` message is received. This means you don't want to be calling functions from inside {@link ChatContainerProps.renderUserDefinedResponse} that you don't want called on every render. Consider putting those function calls inside the React component you render with a `useEffect`.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  ChatContainer,
  RenderUserDefinedState,
  ChatInstance,
} from "@carbon/ai-chat";
import { AISkeletonPlaceholder } from "@carbon/react";
import { Chart } from "./Chart";
import { UserDefinedResponseExample } from "./Example";

const ChatOptions = {
  messaging: {
    customSendMessage: () => {},
  },
};

function App() {
  return (
    <ChatContainer
      renderUserDefinedResponse={renderUserDefinedResponse}
      messaging={chatOptions.messaging}
    />
  );
}

function someFunction() {}

function renderUserDefinedResponse(
  state: RenderUserDefinedState,
  instance: ChatInstance,
) {
  const { messageItem } = state;
  // The state contains details for each user defined response that needs to be rendered.
  // You can also pass information from your component's props or state into the component you return.
  if (messageItem) {
    switch (messageItem.user_defined?.user_defined_type) {
      case "chart":
        someFunction(); // If you do this, this function gets called on every render!
        return (
          <div className="padding">
            {/* Instead, pass someFunction as a prop and run it when the component first mounts with a useEffect(() => { someFunction() }, []). If you are using Strict mode in developement, refer to https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#how-to-handle-the-effect-firing-twice-in-development  */}
            <Chart
              content={messageItem.user_defined.chart_data as string}
              onMount={someFunction}
            />
          </div>
        );
      case "green":
        return (
          <UserDefinedResponseExample
            text={messageItem.user_defined.text as string}
          />
        );
      default:
        return null;
    }
    // Show a skeleton state while waiting for a stream. You can add another switch
    // statement here that does something more specific depending on the component.
    return <AISkeletonPlaceholder className="fullSkeleton" />;
  }
  return null;
}
```

You may also want the renderer to read your app's state, or to stream. Wrap the prop in `useCallback` so it only changes when your state does, and read {@link RenderUserDefinedState.partialItems} for streaming — see [the streaming model](./Responses.md#streaming-and-updates) for how `partialItems` and chunk correlation work. For runnable versions, see the [basic](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/basic) and [streaming](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/reasoning-with-streaming-generic-items) examples.

## Slots

This component also has several elements inside the chat that you can add extra content to with a slot. The {@link ChatContainerProps.renderWriteableElements} prop is an object with the key as the area you want to render a component to and the value being the component to render there. See [Slots](./WriteableElements.md) for the available slots and the corner-alignment attributes (`data-rounded`/`data-stacked`).

Similarly to the {@link ChatContainerProps.renderUserDefinedResponse} prop, if you define your {@link ChatContainerProps.renderWriteableElements} object inside your component, it will be re-created every time your component renders. To avoid this, consider wrapping `renderWriteableElements` in `useMemo` or defining it outside your component. When wrapping with `useMemo` you can also pass values from your component into the slots.

```tsx
import React, { useMemo, useState } from "react";
import { ChatContainer } from "@carbon/ai-chat";
import { AIExplanationTooltipContent } from "./AIExplanationTooltipContent";

const chatOptions = {
  // Your configuration object.
};

function App() {
  const [modelsInUse, setModelsInUse] = useState(["granite-13b-instruct-v2"]);

  const renderWriteableElements = useMemo(
    () => ({
      aiTooltipAfterDescriptionElement: (
        <AIExplanationTooltipContent
          location="aiTooltipAfterDescriptionElement"
          modelsUsed={modelsInUse}
        />
      ),
    }),
    [modelsInUse],
  );

  return <ChatContainer renderWriteableElements={renderWriteableElements} />;
}
```

For a runnable version, see the [workspace example](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/workspace).

## Testing with Jest

Carbon AI Chat exports as an ES module and does not include a CJS build. Please refer to the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/code-transformation) for information about transforming ESM to CJS for Jest using `babel-jest` or `ts-jest`.

See [jsdom examples](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/jest-jsdom) and [happydom examples](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/jest-happydom).

## Custom message footer

Insert a `custom_footer_slot` in assistant messages to render your own content beneath them — copy and share actions, ratings, or links. See [Custom message footer](./CustomMessageFooter.md) for the concept. In React, pass a {@link ChatContainerProps.renderCustomMessageFooter} render prop that returns the footer component:

```tsx
<ChatContainer
  renderCustomMessageFooter={(
    slotName,
    message,
    messageItem,
    instance,
    additionalData,
  ) => (
    <CustomFooterExample
      messageItem={messageItem}
      additionalData={additionalData}
    />
  )}
  messaging={messaging}
/>
```

Like {@link ChatContainerProps.renderUserDefinedResponse}, it runs on every render, so keep per-render work out of it. For the full footer component and the mock backend that attaches the slot, see the [custom message footer example](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-ai-chat/tree/main/examples/react/messages-custom-footer).

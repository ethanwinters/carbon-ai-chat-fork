# `@carbon/ai-chat-components` React

Welcome to the React Storybook for the Carbon AI Chat Components. Here you'll find the React wrappers for our Carbon-flavored AI chat web components, ready to drop into React apps.

## Getting started

Install the package with your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install --save @carbon/ai-chat-components
```

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ai-chat-components
```

### Using the components

Each React export wraps the underlying web component so you get the same API with JSX ergonomics. For example:

```jsx
import Markdown from "@carbon/ai-chat-components/es/react/markdown.js";

function App() {
  return <Markdown highlight># Hello, Carbon AI Chat</Markdown>;
}
```

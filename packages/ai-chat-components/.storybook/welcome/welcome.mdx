# `@carbon/ai-chat-components`

Welcome to the AI Chat Components Storybook
This Storybook showcases the AI Chat Components built with the Carbon Design System. These components are designed to enhance user interaction in AI chat applications, providing a consistent and accessible user experience.

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/ai-chat-components` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install --save @carbon/ai-chat-components
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ai-chat-components
```

### JavaScript framework integration

This package can also be used within other JavaScript frameworks such as Angular and
Vue. This is achievable since web components are the modern browser standard, and
work well with other front-end frameworks that exist in the application. In
turn, this also comes with the benefits of encapsulation within the Shadow DOM.

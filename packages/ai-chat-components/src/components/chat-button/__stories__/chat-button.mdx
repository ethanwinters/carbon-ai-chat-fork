# Chat Button

`<cds-aichat-button>` is an extension of the Carbon Design System’s `<cds-button>` component, designed specifically for AI Chat applications.
the key differences include:
- Rounded corners
- New `is-quick-action` property to render the button as a quick action button.
- Enforced size and kind defaults for quick action buttons.

It supports all the properties of the Carbon Design System’s `<cds-button>` component, with additional AI Chat–specific styles and behaviors.

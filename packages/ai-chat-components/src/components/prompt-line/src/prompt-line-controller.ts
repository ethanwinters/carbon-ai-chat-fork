/**
 * Editing-surface controller contract for `<cds-aichat-prompt-line>`.
 *
 * The prompt-line shell ([./prompt-line.ts]) delegates all editing behavior to
 * a `PromptLineController`. Two implementations exist:
 *
 * - `TextareaController` ([./prompt-line-textarea-runtime.ts]) — a Tiptap-free
 *   `<textarea>`. It is the default and keeps the shell's static import graph
 *   free of `@tiptap/*`.
 * - The rich controller ([./prompt-line-rich-runtime.ts]) — a Tiptap `Editor`,
 *   reached only through a dynamic `import()` so Tiptap lands in its own lazy
 *   chunk.
 *
 * Both controllers emit the **same** `cds-aichat-prompt-*` events with the
 * same detail shapes, so the React wrapper and `@carbon/ai-chat`'s `Input`
 * handlers are identical regardless of mode. The shell can swap a
 * `TextareaController` for the rich controller in place (text, caret, and
 * focus transfer losslessly because the textarea holds plain text).
 *
 * `Editor` / `JSONContent` are **type-only** imports here — erased at compile,
 * so this module carries no Tiptap runtime.
 */
